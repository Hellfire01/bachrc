This is a nice and colorized prompt for your bash<br />

It displays :<br />
- the user name
- the working directory
- the command number
- the return value of the previously executed instruction
- the name of the git branh if there is one

This bashrc was partially created using the <a href="http://bashrcgenerator.com/">bashrc generator</a><br />
It is also possible to get the basics <a href="https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html">here</a><br />

Output exemple :</br>
[matthieu ~/travail_perso/RUBY/MangaScrap_github - 12 - 0 - master]$</br>
 => </br>
